Beginning: It is another rainy day in Madison, and I am driving back to my apartment with a bag of groceries. While waiting for the traffic lights, my phone starts to ring and it 
           turns out to be my mom, saying that my dog was passed away because of the heart attack. It is a dog that have accompanyed with me since elementary school, and I really
           like him. And when lights turn green, I start to cry.
