Beginning: It is another rainy day in Madison, and I am driving back to my apartment with a bag of groceries. While waiting for the traffic lights, my phone starts to ring and it 
           turns out to be my mom, saying that my dog was passed away because of the heart attack. It is a dog that have accompanied with me since elementary school, and I really
           like him. And when lights turn green, I start to cry.
           
Middle:    I have been standing there for a long time as time has stopped. I cannot think of anything and just feel empty. It seems like people passing by are staring at me, but              it does not mean anything to me. After a long time, I start walking again, and in the meantime, it does not rain anymore.
